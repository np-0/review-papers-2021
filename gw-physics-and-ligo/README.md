# Abstract

The project aims to review gravitational waves in general, including detection and LIGO. 
We show the conceptual part of the gravitational waves.
Writing another line to make a pull request.
Yet another one. 

In experimental part we are thinking to stick to few topics like Optics, Lasers, Precision mesurements rather than covering everything (those who are interested in going depth of other domains they are free to do so).  

LIGO Document Control Center (DCC) is good resource to read about GW and LIGO instrument.
