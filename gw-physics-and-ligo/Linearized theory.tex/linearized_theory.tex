Einstein's field equations 
\begin{equation}
    G_{\mu\nu}= \frac{8 \pi  G}{c^{4}}  T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
is a tensor equation which describes gravity in form of Einstein's tensor, $G_{\mu\nu}$ which is directly dependent on the geometry of space-time which is altered by the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$

Another field equation that relates the geometry or curvature of space-time to stress-energy tensor is 

\begin{equation}
    R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Riemann tensor which describes the curvature of space-time, $R$ is the scalar curvature and $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the gravitational field tensor.

Any change in matter distribution will be recorded in in $T_{\mu\nu}$. So if $T_{\mu\nu}$ changes then according to equation 2, gravitational field tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ also has to change. 

If $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the variation induced in space-time then the new gravitational field tensor $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

To get the new gravitational field, Einstein's field equation should be solved for $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ which gives 

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{h}_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} \, \eta_{\mu\nu} \, h^{\alpha}_{\alpha}
\end{equation}
 where $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the gravity where space is flat i.e. $\eta_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu}$ and $h^{\alpha}_{\alpha}$ is summed for all spatial coordinates i.e. $\alpha$ takes values $(1,2,3) $ which corresponds to $(x,y,z)$.
 
 The admitted solutions for this variations in space time $\tilde{h}_{\mu\nu}$ has solution in the form of 
 
 \begin{equation}
     \tilde{h}_{\mu\nu} = A^{\mu\nu}\, e^{ik_{\alpha}x^{\alpha}}
 \end{equation}
 
 which is a 3D wave equation where $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the Amplitude tensor, $i = \sqrt{-1} $, $k_{\alpha} = (k_{x},k_{y},k_{z})$ is the wave vector and $x^{\alpha} = (x^{1},x^{2},x^{2}) = (x,y,z)$ is the position vector.
